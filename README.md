# My Personal Portfolio

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio webpage. It's purpose is to present my skills as a Web Developer. It is fully responsive and has a togglable dark mode. Color scheme on first visit will be determined by user's preferences set on his device. If changed, new choice gets saved in user's local storage so it overrides settings on the device on further visits.

I plan on updating this app with new projects and information as I learn more.

## Technologies

This app was made in React. I used Tailwind and DaisyUI and some of my own CSS to design the page. I also used [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for the contact form, so the emails can be sent directly to me via the form.

I used [Haikei](https://haikei.app/) to generate the background graphics.
